           <p>Excited? Lets Enter in the world of astronomy and discover terms like Solar System, Galaxy, Milky Way  and Planets. You can watch below video which will help you to visualize the terms and undertand better. Today's video Solar System or #alaxy and our Solar System or #Milky way or 9 Planets and Galaxy and our Solar System in this video you will learn #Solar system systems. There are 9 planets in our #solar system and we will explain one by one.</p>

            <h2>Sounds in space: What noises do planets make?</h2>
            <p>In 2022, people on Earth were able to hear the planetary sounds of Mars thanks to two microphones installed on board NASA's Perseverance rover. The audio clips of these sounds in space captured range from a gust of Martian wind to the snapping sound of the rover’s laser hitting a rock.<br/><br/>
            According to NASA, these sounds are subtly different from what you would hear on Earth, being quieter and more muffled due to the lower density and different composition of the Martian atmosphere. Even so, anyone expecting other planets to sound truly "alien" might be disappointed by just how ordinary Perseverance's recordings sound.But there are other possibilities. The planetary sounds we hear, are wavelike vibrations of air molecules occurring within the range of frequencies to which  our ears are sensitive, according to the BBC .<br/><br/>

            <h2>Galaxy</h2>
            A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.<br/><br/>
           Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[7]<br/><br/>
