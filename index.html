            <h2>Sounds in space: What noises do planets make?</h2>
            <p>In 2022, people on Earth were able to hear the planetary sounds of Mars thanks to two microphones installed on board NASA's Perseverance rover. The audio clips of these sounds in space captured range from a gust of Martian wind to the snapping sound of the rover’s laser hitting a rock.<br/><br/>
            According to NASA, these sounds are subtly different from what you would hear on Earth, being quieter and more muffled due to the lower density and different composition of the Martian atmosphere. Even so, anyone expecting other planets to sound truly "alien" might be disappointed by just how ordinary Perseverance's recordings sound.But there are other possibilities. The planetary sounds we hear, are wavelike vibrations of air molecules occurring within the range of frequencies to which  our ears are sensitive, according to the BBC .<br/><br/>

            <h2>Galaxy</h2>
            A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.<br/><br/>
           Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[7]<br/><br/>

            <h2>Milky Way</h2>
            The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning "milky circle".[26][27] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[29] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.<br/><br/>

            The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600 light-years),[10] but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc).[30][31] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.[32][33]<br/><br/>

        <h2>Solar Eclipse 2024 Highlights: Rare Surya Grahan ends on April 9</h2>
        <p>
            Solar Eclipse 2024 Live Updates: Millions of people across parts of Mexico, Canada, and the United States watched the rare total solar eclipse on Monday. The path of totality, a tiny area where the Moon completely obscures the Sun, crossed across cities and sent the United States into a frenzy.<br/><br/>

NASA has shared the captivating live stream on its official broadcast channel on YouTube to witness the solar eclipse. For the first time in nearly a century, the western and northern regions of New York State saw a total eclipse.<br/><br/>

The Mexican beachside resort town of Mazatlan was the first major viewing spot in North America. The partial eclipse began in southern Texas near Eagle Pass on the southern border with Mexico, marking the start of the eclipse in the United States.<br/><br/>

The total solar eclipse of 2024 was a historic celestial event because it won't be visible across the contiguous US again until August 2044 and an annular eclipse -- which happens when the moon can't completely block the sun-- won't appear across this part of the world again until 2046.<br/><br/>

“A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk," NASA's official website stated.<br/><br/>
